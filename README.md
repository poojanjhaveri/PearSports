===============================

PearSports Companion App iOS for CS477B class - USC

Some points to consider :

- Pull/Push/Commit from Xcode itself to avoid other external files which might create trouble using github
- Keep a Copy of your work before you push/pull
- Push as soon as you are done since merging with Xcode is a pain
- Name your files with your initials. For eg. Files coded by poojan will be PJ_...
- Organize your code in Xcode using Folders/Groups.
- Use Xcode Workspace file to code/build/test because we are using cocoapods to install libraries.

Backend
- Daniel, Frank, Alex, Levonne : contact them if you need help with backend
