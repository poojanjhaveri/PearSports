In addition, we may make changes in information about price and availability without notice. While it is our practice to confirm orders by email, the receipt of an email order confirmation does not constitute our acceptance of an order or our confirmation of an offer to sell a product or service. We reserve the right, without prior notice, to limit the order quantity on any product or service and/or to refuse service to any customer.

Despite our best efforts, a small number of the items on our Service may be mispriced. If an item's correct price is higher than our stated price, we will, at our discretion, either contact you for instructions before shipping or cancel your order and notify you of such cancellation. Certain weights, measures and similar descriptions are approximate and are provided for convenience purposes only. It is your responsibility to ascertain and obey all applicable local, state, federal and international laws (including minimum age requirements) in regard to the possession, use and sale of any item purchased from the Service.

The arbitration will be heard and decided no later than seven (7) months after the notice of arbitration is filed with the American Arbitration Association by one arbitrator. The arbitrator will hear and determine any preliminary issue of law asserted by a party to be dispositive of any claim, in whole or in part, in the manner of a court hearing a motion to dismiss for failure to state a claim or for summary judgment, pursuant to such terms and procedures as the arbitrator deems appropriate. No witness or party may be required to waive any privilege recognized under California law. The hearing will not last longer than four (4) days unless all parties agree otherwise, with time to be divided equally between you and Company. The arbitrator will be an attorney, licensed to practice law in the State of California for no less than ten (10) years, with no less than five (5) years’ experience as an arbitrator. The parties and the arbitrator will treat all aspects of the arbitration proceedings, including, without limitation, discovery, testimony and other evidence, briefs, and the award, as strictly confidential and not subject to disclosure to any third party or entity, other than to the parties, the arbitrator, and the American Arbitration Association. The arbitrator must give full effect to the applicable law and to all of these Terms, and are specifically divested of any power to add to, subtract from, modify or alter any of the terms or conditions of these Terms, or to render decisions in derogation thereof. The arbitrator will have no authority to award punitive or other damages not measured by the prevailing party’s actual direct damages, except as may be required by statute. THE PARTIES UNDERSTAND THAT THEY ARE WAIVING THEIR RIGHTS TO A JURY TRIAL OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION. YOU AND COMPANY AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY, AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING. Further, unless both you and Company agree otherwise, the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person's claims, and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding. If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable, then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void. The arbitrator will issue written findings of fact and conclusions of law, the decisions of the arbitrator will be binding and conclusive upon all parties involved, and judgment upon any decision of the arbitrator may be entered in any federal or state courts with jurisdiction. You are solely responsible for your interactions with other users of the Service. Company reserves the right, but has no obligation, to monitor disputes between you and other users of the Service.

Attorney Fees
In any litigation, arbitration or other proceeding by which one party either seeks to enforce its rights under these Terms (whether in contract, tort, or both) or seeks a declaration of any rights or obligations under these Terms, in addition to any other relief to which the prevailing party may be entitled, the prevailing party will be entitled to recover its reasonable attorney fees, costs and expenses to resolve the dispute and to enforce the final judgment.

Legal Compliance
You agree to comply with all local laws and rules regarding use of the Service. Use of the Service is not authorized in any jurisdiction that does not give effect to all provisions of these Terms. The Service is controlled and operated by Company from its offices in the State of California, in the United States of America. Company makes no representation that any of the Service (including, without limitation, any products or services available on or through the Service) are available or appropriate for use outside of the United States of America. Your use of or access to the Service should not be construed as Company’s purposefully availing itself of the benefits or privilege of doing business in any state or jurisdiction other than California.

U.S. Export Laws
This Service and/or products offered on the Service may be subject to the export laws, restrictions, regulations and administrative acts of the United States Department of Commerce, Department of Treasury Office of Foreign Assets Control (“OFAC”), State Department, and other United States authorities (collectively, “U.S. Export Laws”). Users shall not export or re-export, or allow the export or re-export of, the Service and/or products offered on the Service in violation of any U.S. Export Laws. None of the Service or products offered on the Service may be downloaded or otherwise exported or re-exported (i) into (or to a national or resident of) any country to which the United States has embargoed goods; or (ii) to anyone on the U.S. Treasury Department's list of Specially Designated Nationals or the U.S. Commerce Department's Table of Deny Orders, or any other denied parties lists under U.S. Export Laws. By using the Service, you agree to the foregoing and represent and warrant that you are not a national or resident of, located in, or under the control of, any restricted country; and you are not on any denied parties list; and you agree to comply with all U.S. Export Laws (including “anti-boycott”, “deemed export” and “deemed re-export” regulations). If you access the Service from other countries or jurisdictions, you do so on your own initiative and you are solely responsible for compliance with the local laws of that jurisdiction, if and to the extent those local laws are applicable and do not conflict with U.S. Export Laws. If such laws conflict with U.S. Export Laws, you shall not access the Service.

Government Users
All software licensed pursuant to these Terms and related documentation are "Commercial Items", as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. §2.101, consisting of "Commercial Computer Software" and "Commercial Computer Software Documentation", as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. §12.212 or 48 C.F.R. §227.7202, as applicable.

Severability
If any provision(s) of these Terms, including without limitation, the warranty disclaimers and liability limitations set forth above, are found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable, then the invalid or unenforceable provision will be deemed superseded by a valid, enforceable provision that most closely matches the intent of the original provision and the remainder of these Terms shall continue in effect. The foregoing does not apply to the prohibition against class or representative actions that is part of the arbitration clause; if that prohibition is found to be unenforceable, the arbitration clause (but only the arbitration clause) shall be null and void.

Section Titles; Survival
The section titles in these Terms are for convenience only and have no legal or contractual effect. Sections 3, 5 and 9 through 22 of these Terms, as well as any payment obligations to Company, shall survive any termination of your account, your access to the Service, or these Terms.

Legal Equivalency
These Terms and any other electronic documents, policies and guidelines incorporated herein shall be: (i) deemed for all purposes to be a “writing” or “in writing,” and to comply with all statutory, contractual, and other legal requirements for a writing; (ii) legally enforceable against any party hereto as a signed writing; and (iii) deemed an “original” when printed from electronic records established and maintained in the ordinary course of business. Any electronic documents introduced as evidence in any judicial, arbitration, mediation or administrative proceeding shall, if established and maintained in the ordinary course of business, be admissible to the same extent as business records in written form that are similarly established and maintained.</string>
