\n
\nThe 14-week schedule trims the fat to include only high quality workouts and what is necessary to perform at your best.  
\n
\n
\nPerfect for the time-crunched runner, the training plan includes three focused high quality running workouts per week.  If you find you have more time on your hands, you can add two cross-training workouts to the mix. 
\n
\nThe plan builds slowly to allow your body to adapt to the demands of the training so you can run stronger for longer and includes long endurance runs, interval and tempo workouts, and recovery runs. 
\n
\nThis is an intermediate level training plan and is geared to those who have been running three times per week for 40-60 minutes for at least six months.";

\n
\nThe 14-week schedule trims the fat to include only high quality workouts and what is necessary to perform at your best.  
\n
\n
\nPerfect for the time-crunched runner, the training plan includes three focused high quality running workouts per week.  If you find you have more time on your hands, you can add two cross-training workouts to the mix. 
\n
\nThe plan builds slowly to allow your body to adapt to the demands of the training so you can run stronger for longer and includes long endurance runs, interval and tempo workouts, and recovery runs. 
\n
\nThis is an intermediate level training plan and is geared to those who have been running three times per week for 40-60 minutes for at least six months.";

\nPerfect for the time-crunched runner, the training plan includes three focused high quality running workouts per week.  If you find you have more time on your hands, you can add two cross-training workouts to the mix. 
\n
\nThe plan builds slowly to allow your body to adapt to the demands of the training so you can run stronger for longer and includes long endurance runs, interval and tempo workouts, and recovery runs. 
\n
\nThis is an intermediate level training plan and is geared to those who have been running three times per week for 40-60 minutes for at least six months.";

\n
\nThe 14-week schedule trims the fat to include only high quality workouts and what is necessary to perform at your best.  
\n
\n
\nPerfect for the time-crunched runner, the training plan includes three focused high quality running workouts per week.  If you find you have more time on your hands, you can add two cross-training workouts to the mix. 
\n
\nThe plan builds slowly to allow your body to adapt to the demands of the training so you can run stronger for longer and includes long endurance runs, interval and tempo workouts, and recovery runs. 
\n
\nThis is an intermediate level training plan and is geared to those who have been running three times per week for 40-60 minutes for at least six months.";

\n
\nThe 14-week schedule trims the fat to include only high quality workouts and what is necessary to perform at your best.  
\n
\n
\nPerfect for the time-crunched runner, the training plan includes three focused high quality running workouts per week.  If you find you have more time on your hands, you can add two cross-training workouts to the mix. 
\n
\nThe plan builds slowly to allow your body to adapt to the demands of the training so you can run stronger for longer and includes long endurance runs, interval and tempo workouts, and recovery runs. 
\n
\nThis is an intermediate level training plan and is geared to those who have been running three times per week for 40-60 minutes for at least six months.";

\n
\nThe 14-week schedule trims the fat to include only high quality workouts and what is necessary to perform at your best.  
\n
\n
\nPerfect for the time-crunched runner, the training plan includes three focused high quality running workouts per week.  If you find you have more time on your hands, you can add two cross-training workouts to the mix. 
\n
\nThe plan builds slowly to allow your body to adapt to the demands of the training so you can run stronger for longer and includes long endurance runs, interval and tempo workouts, and recovery runs. 
\n
\nThis is an intermediate level training plan and is geared to those who have been running three times per week for 40-60 minutes for at least six months.";

\n
\nThe 14-week schedule trims the fat to include only high quality workouts and what is necessary to perform at your best.  
\n
\n
\nPerfect for the time-crunched runner, the training plan includes three focused high quality running workouts per week.  If you find you have more time on your hands, you can add two cross-training workouts to the mix. 
\n
\nThe plan builds slowly to allow your body to adapt to the demands of the training so you can run stronger for longer and includes long endurance runs, interval and tempo workouts, and recovery runs. 
\n
\nThis is an intermediate level training plan and is geared to those who have been running three times per week for 40-60 minutes for at least six months.";

\nThe 14-week schedule trims the fat to include only high quality workouts and what is necessary to perform at your best.  
\n
\n
\nPerfect for the time-crunched runner, the training plan includes three focused high quality running workouts per week.  If you find you have more time on your hands, you can add two cross-training workouts to the mix. 
\n
\nThe plan builds slowly to allow your body to adapt to the demands of the training so you can run stronger for longer and includes long endurance runs, interval and tempo workouts, and recovery runs. 
\n
\nThis is an intermediate level training plan and is geared to those who have been running three times per week for 40-60 minutes for at least six months.";
